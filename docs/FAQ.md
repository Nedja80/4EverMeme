## Technical Questions

### What wallet should I use?

We recommend:
- **Beginners**: Trust Wallet (mobile) or MetaMask (desktop)
- **Advanced**: Ledger or Trezor hardware wallets
- **Traders**: Binance Chain Wallet or MetaMask

### What is gas and why do I need BNB?

Gas is the fee paid to BSC validators for processing transactions. You need a small amount of BNB in your wallet to pay for gas fees when transferring 4EVM.

### How long do transactions take?

BSC transactions typically confirm in 3-5 seconds, though it may take longer during network congestion.

### Can I send 4EVM to an Ethereum address?

**No!** 4EVM is a BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain. Sending to an Ethereum address may result in permanent loss of funds. Always ensure you're on the correct network.

### What's the difference between BEP-20 and ERC-20?

- **BEP-20**: Token standard on BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- **ERC-20**: Token standard on Ethereum

4EVM is BEP-20 only. The standards are similar but on different blockchains.

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction is pending forever, what do I do?

1. Check if transaction appears on BscScan
2. If stuck, try increasing gas price and resubmitting
3. If failed, check error message on BscScan
4. Make sure you have enough BNB for gas

### I sent 4EVM to the wrong address, can I get it back?

Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Always double-check addresses before sending.

### The price looks different on my wallet vs DEX, why?

Wallets often show delayed prices from price aggregators. For real-time prices, check DEX directly.

### I can't add 4EVM to my wallet

Make sure:
1. You're on BNB Smart Chain network
2. You're using the correct contract address
3. Your wallet supports BEP-20 tokens
4. You're using the latest wallet version
